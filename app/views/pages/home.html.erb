            <p>Tech-savvy with a business background, I’ve spend the last 6 months on combining my full time job with a web development coding bootcamp at Le Wagon.</p>
            <p>I do not give up easily. Committing most of my evenings (loong evenings!) and weekends, with a smile on my face, I’ve not only learnt to code but also how to manage my time efficiently, prioritise tasks and excelled multitasking! I understand and can build tools that solve real life problems. It makes me super happy! </p>
            <p>I love to travel. Currently based in Barcelona, Spain but I’ve been living in 5 different countries, always pushing for new challenges.</p>
