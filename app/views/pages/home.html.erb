        Tech-savvy with a business background, I’ve spend the last 6 months on combining my full time job with a web development coding bootcamp at Le Wagon. I do not give up easily. Committing most of my evenings and weekends, with a smile on my face, I’ve not only learnt to code but also how to manage my time efficiently, prioritise tasks and excelled multitasking! I understand and can build tools that solve real life problems. As a team player, I couldn't have done it without the amazing team of multinational people. Thanks to Le Wagon, now I truly believe that technology is the future, and I want to be part of it, I want to have an impact. Without hesitation, no matter how challanging it can be, I would like to continue this learning journey.
